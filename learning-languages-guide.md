## Stage 1 - exploration

1. Look at the documentation, and a guide or two - what is the underlying principals? Why was the language created?
2. Look at learn x in y minutes for a good base syntax guide. Play about with it in the command line
   - Do some boolean comparisons
   - How do you loop? (can you?)
   - What do you get back when you try to do something like 1 + '1'?
   - What paradigms is it following - is it multiple?
3. Look at the different types - is there one just
4. Try and compare to other languages - how is it different?How is it similar?
5. Find a style guide - are the vscode auto formatting extensions?
6. Find example problems (E.g. project Euler - ideally with solutions.)
7. Find a community that can answer questions

## Stage 2 - more indepth

1. What are the main problems being solved with this language? - try using it for those
2. Gradually ramp up the challenge, what's jarring about the language - what's it pushing back on? What is really nice and smooth? 
3. Look up a bit more blogs about the language, how do their views on it match your experience?
